# VS Code MCP WebSocket Server Enhancement Ideas

This document outlines potential enhancements for the VS Code MCP WebSocket Server extension, based on the current implementation and roadmap.

## User Experience Improvements

### Status Notifications

- **Visual Notifications**: Show toast notifications for important events (connection established, command executed, etc.)
- **Custom Status Bar Items**: Extend status bar to show active clients, recent commands, etc.
- **Logging Panel**: Create a dedicated output panel for MCP server logs

### Configuration Enhancements

- **Connection Profiles**: Allow saving and switching between different server configurations
- **Per-Command Settings**: Configure default behavior for specific commands
- **Command Aliases**: Define custom aliases for frequently used commands

## Security Features

### Authentication Mechanisms

- **Token-Based Auth**: Implement JWT or similar token authentication
- **API Keys**: Support for API key-based authentication
- **Connection Allowlist**: Restrict connections to specific IP addresses or domains

### Permission System

- **Command Permissions**: Fine-grained control over which commands are allowed
- **Read/Write Permissions**: Separate permissions for reading vs. modifying files
- **Workspace Restrictions**: Limit operations to specific workspace folders

## New Command Capabilities

### Editor Extensions

- **Multi-Cursor API**: Place and manipulate multiple cursors programmatically
- **Snippet Insertion**: Insert predefined or custom snippets
- **Selection Enhancements**: Select by scope (function, class, block, etc.)

### Workspace Operations

- **Project Templates**: Generate new projects from templates
- **Bulk File Operations**: Process multiple files with a single command
- **Metadata Retrieval**: Get project structure, dependencies, etc.

### Terminal Integration

- **Terminal Session Management**: Create, interact with, and close terminal sessions
- **Command Execution**: Run commands in terminal and capture output
- **Environment Variables**: Set/get environment variables for terminal sessions

## Performance Optimizations

- **Message Compression**: Compress large messages for better performance
- **Batch Operations**: Support for sending multiple commands in a single request
- **Incremental Updates**: Send only changed portions of files when saving

## Integration Capabilities

### External Services

- **AI Service Integration**: Connect with OpenAI, Claude, or other AI services
- **Git Integration**: Perform Git operations via the WebSocket API
- **CI/CD Hooks**: Trigger or respond to CI/CD pipeline events

### Extension Integrations

- **Language Server Protocol**: Expose LSP features via WebSocket
- **Debugger Integration**: Control debugging sessions remotely
- **Extension API Bridge**: Access other VS Code extension APIs

## Client-Side Improvements

- **Language-Specific Clients**: Official client libraries for popular languages (Python, JavaScript, etc.)
- **CLI Tool**: Command-line interface for quick interactions
- **GUI Client**: Standalone GUI application for managing VS Code instances

## Testing and Reliability

- **Command Playback**: Record and replay sequences of commands
- **Load Testing Support**: Tools for testing server performance under load
- **Mock Mode**: Allow testing without actually modifying files

## Documentation

- **Interactive API Explorer**: Web-based tool for exploring and testing the API
- **Example Projects**: More comprehensive examples for common use cases
- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides for different automation scenarios

## Community Features

- **Command Marketplace**: Share and discover useful command sequences
- **Extension Directory**: Showcase projects using the MCP server
- **Telemetry (opt-in)**: Gather usage data to inform future development
